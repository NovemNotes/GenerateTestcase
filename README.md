# GenerateTestcase
This project was created while I was in the POSN camp I make it to help my teacher make the problem and generate testcase to use in CMS grader.

first, let's see how to use it

->generate input testcase

  first, you should to put the python program that you want to generate testcase in the folder input testcase
  
  then, you fill the information in the program like number of the testcase or limit of n and m etc.
  
  the file will save in the same folder with the python program
  
  finally, you will have the testcase file that file extension is .in 

->generate output testcase
  
  easily to make output file cause you have the c or c++ program solution!

  first, you should to put the python program that you want to genarate testcase in the folder input file (cause this program will scan input file and run it)
  
  then, run the program and put the information in input page : you should to put path of file.exe that run the solution program
  
  when the program run file.exe it will give the input file in the file.exe and save output file in the same folder with input file
  
  finally, you will have the testcase file that file extension is .sol

If you want to put the testcase in CMS grader you should to compress all input and output file in the file extension .zip
then upload .zip to the CMS grader and put the information " *.in " in input box and " *.sol" in output box.

Cause I just learned to do this program for the first time.
If there are any errors in the program. I apologize here
